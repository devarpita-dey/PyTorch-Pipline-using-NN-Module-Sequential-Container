# PyTorch-Custom Neural Network using-NN-Module-Sequential-Container
A streamlined project that demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate neural networks in PyTorch using the nn.Module class. This repository is designed to serve as a template or guide for building custom pipelines for machine learning and deep learning projects.  
**Key Features**

Custom Neural Network Architectures: Leverage the power of PyTorch's nn.Module to design modular, reusable, and flexible models.
nn.Sequential Container: Simplify model definitions using PyTorchâ€™s Sequential container, which allows you to stack layers in a concise and readable manner.
