# PyTorch-Pipline-using-NN-Module-Sequential-Container
A streamlined project that demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate neural networks in PyTorch using the nn.Module class. This repository is designed to serve as a template or guide for building custom pipelines for machine learning and deep learning projects.
